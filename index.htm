<h1>My_JamaicaTrip</h1>
<p> Day one in Port Maria always starts slow. The trip is trying to become familiar with their new home for the next week, which happens to be absolutely breathtaking. The Casa Maria Hotel is less than a tenth of a mile from the beach, and the only thing separating the two is a 2-lane highway with seemingly no speed limit in which cars fly by with enormous speakers bungee corded to the top so the world can hear what they are listening to. After everyone has taken in the incredible view, awkwardness sets in. It's time for dinner and the freshman either sit with their friends, or they choose to be brave and sit at a table full of other freshman they have never seen before. From the sidelines the leaders get to witness the awkwardness begin, and fade away within minutes. That seemingly giant leap of faith to start a conversation with someone they barely know seems incredibly small once they start talking. A since of joy, love, and eagerness flood The Casa Maria as the first night comes to a close with hopes of an exciting day to come. </p>

<p> Day two is just as slow as day one. Everyone wakes up and realizes they weren’t dreaming the night before and their new home actually was breath-taking. The 3 days that follow are some of the toughest days to get through. All 77 people are pushed to their limits on the verge of exhaustion and definite dehydration but somehow there isn’t a frown to be found. In fact there is more joy in everyone heart than the day they showed up, even though these are by far the hardest days. Love and morale continue to skyrocket as everyone learns more and more about the person next to them. Still no one seems to mind being soaked in sweat, drinking water bottle after water bottle just to play keep up and not pass out because they just love each other and love serving. The leaders’ hearts melt at the sight of new friendships forming before their eyes. All 3 nights are filled with 

<p> Day 6 begins with lots of hope  </p>
